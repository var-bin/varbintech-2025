    question: "How long does a typical web development project take?",
    answer: "Project timelines vary based on complexity and scope. A simple website might take 4-6 weeks, while a complex web application could take 3-6 months. During our initial consultation, we'll provide a detailed timeline based on your specific requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies do you use?",
    answer: "We work with modern web technologies including React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, and various backend frameworks. Our stack is chosen based on your project's specific needs rather than a one-size-fits-all approach."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a website or web application cost?",
    answer: "Pricing depends on the complexity, features, and timeline of your project. Our website packages start at $4,999, while web applications start at $9,999. For enterprise solutions, we provide custom quotes based on your requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ongoing maintenance and support?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer various maintenance packages to keep your website or application secure, up-to-date, and functioning optimally. All our projects include an initial support period, and extended support can be arranged based on your needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with an existing project or do you only build from scratch?",
    answer: "We can help with both! Whether you need to enhance an existing website, fix issues, or build something entirely new, our team has the expertise to assist you."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your payment structure?",
    answer: "We typically work with a 50% upfront deposit and the remaining 50% upon project completion. For larger projects, we can arrange milestone-based payments to spread the cost throughout the development process."
